# Iris Flower Classification

## Project Overview
This project uses a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species based on the length and width of their sepals and petals. The model is trained using the famous Iris dataset and implements a Random Forest Classifier. The system is capable of making predictions on new flower measurements.
